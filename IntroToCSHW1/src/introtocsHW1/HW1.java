        rightWall parallel to the y axis, and one cieling parallel to the x
        axis.
        
        The balls diameter is in the variable with the same name, which you 
        also do not know.
        
        You need to update the location and velocity variables for a single time 
        increment.
        
        When the ball is away from the edges of the box, it location is affected
        only by its velocity.  The velocity values are added to the location
        values.  The velocity itself is unchanged in this case.
        
        For example, if xLoc = 30, yLoc = 20, xVel = 5, and yVel = -5, then 
        you need to set xLoc = 35 and yLoc = 15.
        
        For the purpose of this exercise, we assume that the ball has 100% 
        elasticity. That means that if the ball hits the wall it's velocity
        orhthagonal to the wall is reversed, i.e. mulitiplied by -1, and the 
        ball moves in the opposited direction.  
        
        The x-velocity is reversed when the ball hits the y axis and rightWall.
        The y-velocity is reversed when the ball hits the x axis and the ceiling.
        
        For example, if a ball has a xLoc = 4 and xVel = -10, and a diameter = 4
        then it's new x-location will be xLoc = 10.  
        It moved 2 toward the x-axis, when the edge of the ball at radius two 
        hit the axis. Then moves 8 back up totalling 2 + 8 = 10, 
        the ball's speed.  
        Its x-velocity is now xVel=+10.  
        All other values remain unchanged since the ball isn't near any other 
        walls.
        
        For example, if the ball is near the ceiling, let xLoc = 20, 
        yLoc = 50, xVel = 2, and yVel = 5, and cieling = 53. The ball moves a 
        total distance of five, up three, hits the cieling, and comes down two.  
        yLoc = 51.
        The velocity is changed to yVel = -5, since the ball bounced off the 
        cieling and is now headed in the opposite direction. 
        xLoc = 22 since it is unnefected by the wall. 
        Similarly, xVel is unefected.
        
        Ignore any effext of gravity or other physics processes, as they are
        outside the scope of this question.

        This is not the best way to find pi.  But it is a good way to practice 
        some basic programing skills.
        
        Consider a square with vertices at:
        (1,1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), and (-1, -1).
        
        The area of the square is 4.
        
        The unit circle is a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1.
        The area of the unit circle is pi.
        
        Consider n uniformly distributed points in the square.  
        Suppose m of those points are in the circle.
        Then m/n (the fraction of the points in the cirle) 
        approaches pi/4 (the ratio of the circle arae to the square area) 
        as n approaches infinity.
        The bigger n is, the closer m/n will be to pi/4.
        
        Equivilently, 4*m/n approaches pi.
        
        We can approximate pi by choosing large values for n.
        
        Test a grid, a set of equaly-spaced points in the square, 
        for membership in the  circle.
        The bottom left point in your grid should be the point (-1,-1),
        and the top right point in your grid should be (1,1).
        The width and height of the grid should be the variable gridWidth,
        defined for you above.  You do not know the value of gridWith.
        
        For example, if gridWidth = 3, then the grid will be the following set
        of 9 points: (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), 
        (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1).
        
        Set pi = The number of grid points that are in the unit circle, 
        times four, divided by the total number of grid points.  
        
        You can check if some point, (x, y) is in the unit circle by checking
        if x^2 + y^2 <= 1.
        
        You should find that as gridWidth increases, your value for pi will get
        closer and closer to the actual value of pi.  Whe gridWidth is 10000,
        your pi shold be acurate to 3.141 plus or minus 1e-4.
        
        For no extra credit, except that you'll learn more:
        What can you change about the algorithm to make it more 
        four times faster.  Be sure to back up your claims with sound math.
